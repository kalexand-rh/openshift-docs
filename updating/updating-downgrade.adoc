In some situations, you can downgrade {product-title} to an earlier version
within the same minor release that you previously installed. You can only
downgrade with a minor release because the releases within a minor release,
often called "z-stream" releases, do not introduce breaking API changes. While
they are avoided, breaking API changes are sometimes introduced between minor
releases.

For example, if you updated your cluster from version 4.1.13 to version 4.1.14,
it might be possible to revert your cluster to version 4.1.13. If you updated
from version 4.1.17 to version 4.2.0, it is not possible to revert your cluster
to version 4.1.17.

Contact Red Hat support for assistance with downgrading your cluster.
