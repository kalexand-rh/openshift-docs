Containers can specify compute resource requests and limits. Requests are used
for scheduling your container and provide a minimum service guarantee. Limits
constrain the amount of compute resource that may be consumed on your node.

The scheduler attempts to optimize the compute resource use across all nodes in
your cluster. It places pods onto specific nodes, taking the pods' compute
resource requests and nodes' available capacity into consideration.

Requests and limits enable administrators to allow and manage the overcommitment
of resources on a node, which may be desirable in development environments where
a tradeoff of guaranteed performance for capacity is acceptable.

[IMPORTANT]
====
To avoid erratic cluster behavior due to scheduling collisions between the
hypervisor and Kubernetes, do not overcommit at the hypervisor level.
