= About source control management

{product-title} takes advantage of preexisting source control management (SCM) systems
hosted either internally (such as an in-house Git server) or externally (for
example, on link:https://github.com/[GitHub], link:https://bitbucket.org/[Bitbucket],
etc.). Currently, {product-title} only supports link:https://git-scm.com/[Git] solutions.

SCM integration is tightly coupled with builds, the two points being:

- Creating a `BuildConfig` using a repository, which allows building your
manually or let {product-title} create it automatically by inspecting your repository.
- Triggering a build upon repository changes.
