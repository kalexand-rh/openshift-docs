= Installation on other platforms

You can deploy {product-title} 4 to many on-premise and public cloud providers in addition to bare metal physical servers. While Red Hat is working to expand provider support in future releases, you might need to deploy {product-title} in their environment in advance of Red Hat delivering this capability.

The bare metal installation method provides a generic approach for deploying {product-title} 4 to environments that lack formal integration with your private or public cloud provider. You must be aware of the constraints associated with this deployment method in advance of deploying a {product-title} 4 cluster and plan accordingly.

After you familiarize yourself with the installation process, you can deploy {product-title} 4 to most environments. Be aware of a number of areas where this installation method might not support your particular provider or might even require minor modifications when deploying {product-title}. Remember, these areas are only applicable if you are trying to use the bare metal installation method to deploy {product-title} on virtualization or cloud solutions that Red Hat has not yet tested or provided a documented installation method for.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The following restrictions are applicable only when using the {product-title} 4 bare metal installation method to deploy {product-title} on a RHEL certified virtualization or cloud provider that {product-title} 4 has not yet been specifically developed for or link:https://access.redhat.com/articles/4128421[tested on].
====

* {op-system-first}: Validate the level of support available from {op-system} for the targeted server hardware or virtualization technology. Levels of support range from certified to commercially reasonable. For more information, see the listings for ‘Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8’ in the link:https://access.redhat.com/ecosystem/search/#/ecosystem/Red%20Hat%20Enterprise%20Linux[Red Hat Enterprise Linux Certified Ecosystem] page.

* Guest Management Agent: Many virtualization solutions or clouds require the use of an agent that is loaded on the operating system. Required agents must be installed as a containerized workload deployed via a daemon set. Non-containerized agents are not supported on {op-system}.

* OpenShift Cloud Provider: The OpenShift Cloud Provider provides an interface between an {product-title} cluster and the cloud provider’s API and is required to use features such as dynamic storage, on-demand service routing, node hostname to kubernetes hostname resolution, and cluster autoscaling. An {product-title} 4 cluster will not have access to these capabilities if there is no cloud provider integration.

[NOTE]
====
With bare metal installations on clouds, it is common to mix resources from different services and providers or configure the cluster to span physical and virtual boundaries. In these situations, you cannot enable the cloud provider integrations. The nodeControllerLifecycle does not allow nodes from outside of the cloud provider to be added to the cluster, and you cannot specify more than one cloud provider integration.
====

* Machine API: To use MachineSets or cluster-autoscaling to automate the provisioning of nodes within the cluster, {product-title} requires a machine API implementation for the targeted provider. Without the Machine API, a cluster administrator must create and join nodes to the {product-title} 4 cluster.

* Ignition Handling: As part of the {op-system} bootstrap process, you must provide an Ignition config file to the host. A number of cloud providers have the mechanism to inject the Ignition config to the system as an initial part of its deployment. Use this this functionality if it is available. Where the provider does not have this functionality, administrators must host the Ignition configs on a separate HTTP server.

* VM format: Determine if Red Hat offers a pre-built VM disk format of {op-system} for your environment. If not, administrators must deploy {op-system} by using the ISO image, which is part of the procedure to manually deploy the nodes.

* Persistent Storage: Storage must be manually provisioned to use the optional framework components such as the embedded container registry, ElasticSearch, and Prometheus. Unless configured, bare metal deployments do not define a default storage class.

* Load Balancers: The control plane requires a load balancer to distribute API requests across all 3 master nodes for in a highly available architecture. While link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html-single/load_balancer_administration/index#ch-haproxy-setup-VSA[Red Hat Enterprise Linux] ships with tools to provide load balancer functionality, any TCP-based load balancing solution that meets the DNS routing and port requirements is acceptable.
