= Support for Kubernetes ingress objects

The Kubernetes ingress object is a configuration object determining how inbound
connections reach internal services. {product-title} has support for these
objects using a ingress controller configuration file.

This controller watches ingress objects and creates one or more routes to
satisfy the conditions of the ingress object. The controller is also responsible
for keeping the ingress object and generated route objects synchronized. This
includes giving generated routes permissions on the secrets associated with the
ingress object.
