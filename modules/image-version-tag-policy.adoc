= Image version tag policy

Rather than version numbers, the Docker service allows applying tags (such as
`v1`, `v2.1`, `GA`, or the default `latest`) in addition to the image name to
further specify the image desired, so you may see the same image referred to as
`centos` (implying the `latest` tag), `centos:centos7`, or `fd44297e2ddb`.

[WARNING]
====
Do not use the `latest` tag for any official {product-title} images. These are
images that start with `openshift3/`. `latest` can refer to a number of
versions, such as `3.10`, or `3.11`.
====

How you tag the images dictates the updating policy. The more specific you are, the less frequently the image will be updated. Use the following to determine your chosen {product-title} images policy:

vX.Y::
The vX.Y tag points to X.Y.Z-<number>. For example, if the `registry-console`
image is updated to v3.11, it points to the newest 3.11.Z-<number> tag, such
as 3.11.1-8.

X.Y.Z::
Similar to the vX.Y example above, the X.Y.Z tag points to the latest
X.Y.Z-<number>. For example, 3.11.1 would point to 3.11.1-8

X.Y.Z-<number>::
The tag is unique and does not change. When using this tag, the image does not update if an image is updated. For example, the 3.11.1-8 will always point to 3.11.1-8, even if an image is updated.
