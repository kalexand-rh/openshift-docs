= Container image registries

A container image registry is a service for storing and retrieving Docker-formatted
container images. A registry contains a collection of one or more image
repositories. Each image repository contains one or more tagged images. Docker
provides its own registry, the link:https://registry.hub.docker.com/[Docker Hub],
and you can also use private or third-party registries. Red Hat provides a
registry at `registry.redhat.io` for subscribers. {product-title} can
also supply its own internal registry for managing custom container images.

The relationship between containers, images, and registries is depicted in the
