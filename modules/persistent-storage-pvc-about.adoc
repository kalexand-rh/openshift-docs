= About PersistentVolumeClaims

Each PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) contains a `spec` and `status`, which is the
specification and status of the claim.

Claims can optionally request a specific storage class by specifying the storage
class's name in the `storageClassName` attribute. Only PVs of the requested
class, ones with the same `storageClassName` as the PVC, can be bound to the
PVC. The cluster administrator can configure dynamic provisioners to service one
or more storage classes. The cluster administrator can create a PV on demand
that matches the specifications in the PVC.

The cluster administrator can also set a default storage class for all PVCs.
When a default storage class is configured, the PVC must explicitly ask for
`StorageClass` or `storageClassName` annotations set to `""` to be bound to a
PV without a storage class.

Claims use the same conventions as volumes when requesting storage with specific
access modes.

Claims, such as pods, can request specific quantities of a resource. In this case,
the request is for storage. The same resource model applies to volumes and claims.

Pods access storage by using the claim as a volume. Claims must exist in the
same namespace as the pod by using the claim. The cluster finds the claim in the
pod's namespace and uses it to get the `PersistentVolume` backing the claim.
The volume is mounted to the host and into the pod.
