= About templates

A template describes a set of objects that
can be parameterized and processed to produce a list of objects for creation
by {product-title}. The objects to create can include anything that users have
permission to create within a project, for example services, build
configurations, and deployment configurations. A template can also define a set
of labels to apply to every object defined in the template.
