= Routes

An {product-title} route exposes a service at a
host name, such as _www.example.com_, so that external clients can reach it by
name.

DNS resolution for a host name is handled separately from routing.
Your administrator may have configured a DNS wildcard entry
that will resolve to the {product-title} node that is running the
{product-title} router. If you are using a different host name you may
need to modify its DNS records independently to resolve to the node that
is running the router.

Each route consists of a name (limited to 63 characters), a service selector,
and an optional security configuration.
