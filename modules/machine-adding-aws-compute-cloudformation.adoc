[id="machine-adding-aws-compute-cloudformation_{context}"]
= Adding more compute machines to your AWS cluster by using CloudFormation templates

You can add more compute machines to your {product-title} cluster on
Amazon Web Services (AWS) that you
created by using the sample CloudFormation templates.

.Procedure

[IMPORTANT]
====
The CloudFormation template creates a stack that represents one worker machine.
You must create a stack for each worker machine.
====

[NOTE]
====
If you do not use the provided CloudFormation template to create your worker
nodes, you must review the provided information and manually create
the infrastructure. If your cluster does not initialize correctly, you might
have to contact Red Hat support with your installation logs.
====

.Prerequisites

* You installed an {product-title} cluster by using CloudFormation templates
and have access to the JSON file and CloudFormation template that you used to create the
worker machines during cluster installation.
* You installed the AWS CLI.

.Procedure

. Create another worker stack.
.. Launch the template:
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
You must enter the command on a single line.
====
+
----
$ aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name <name> <1>
     --template-body file://<template>.yaml \ <2>
     --parameters file://<parameters>.json <3>
----
<1> `<name>` is the name for the CloudFormation stack, such as `cluster-workers`.
You need the name of this stack if you remove the cluster.
<2> `<template>` is the relative path to and name of the CloudFormation template
YAML file that you saved.
<3> `<parameters>` is the relative path to and name of the CloudFormation
parameters JSON file.

.. Confirm that the template components exist:
+
----
$ aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name <name>
----

. Continue to create worker stacks until you have created enough worker Machines
for your cluster.
