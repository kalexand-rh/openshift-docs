ArgoCD is a declarative continuous delivery tool that leverages GitOps to maintain cluster resources. ArgoCD is implemented as a controller that continuously monitors application definitions and configurations that you defined in a Git repository and compares the current state of those configurations with their live states on the cluster. Configurations that deviate from their state in the Git repository are classified as `OutOfSync`. ArgoCD reports these differences, and you can automatically or manually update the configurations to the current state.

While you can use the GitOps tool of your choice with {product-title}, the following procedures outline its use.

See link:https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/[Argo CD - Declarative GitOps CD for Kubernetes], the ArgoCD documentation, for more information.
