= Node types in {product-title}

{product-title} uses bootstrap, master, and worker nodes. The bootstrap node
provides the initial configuration to clusters. Master nodes run the cluster
infrastructure and required components. Instead of being grouped into a `MachineSet`,
they are a series of standalone machine API resources. Extra controls apply to
master nodes to prevent you from deleting all master nodes and breaking your
cluster. The worker nodes drive compute workloads. Each type of worker node is
governed by a specific machine pool that autoscales them.
