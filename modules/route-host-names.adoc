= Route host names
In order for services to be exposed externally, an {product-title} route allows
you to associate a service with an externally-reachable host name. This edge
host name is then used to route traffic to the service.

When multiple routes from different namespaces claim the same host,
the oldest route wins and claims it for the namespace. If additional
routes with different path fields are defined in the same namespace,
those paths are added. If multiple routes with the same path are
used, the oldest takes priority.

A consequence of this behavior is that if you have two routes for a host name: an
older one and a newer one. If someone else has a route for the same host name
that they created between when you created the other two routes, then if you
delete your older route, your claim to the host name will no longer be in effect.
The other namespace now claims the host name and your claim is lost.

If a host name is not provided as part of the route definition, then
{product-title} automatically generates one for you.
