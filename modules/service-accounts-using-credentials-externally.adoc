= Using a service account's credentials externally

You can distribute a service account's token to external applications that need to
authenticate to the API.

In order to pull an image, the authenticated user must have `get` rights on the
requested `imagestreams/layers`. In order to push an image, the authenticated
user must have `update` rights on the requested `imagestreams/layers`.

By default, all service accounts in a project have rights to pull any image in
the same project, and the *builder* service account has rights to push any image
in the same project.

.Procedure

+
[source,bash]
