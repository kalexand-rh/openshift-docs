= Labels

Labels are used to organize, group, or select API objects.
For example, pods are "tagged" with labels, and then
services]use label selectors to identify the pods they
proxy to. This makes it possible for services to reference groups of
pods, even treating pods with potentially different containers
as related entities.

Most objects can include labels in their metadata. So labels can
be used to group arbitrarily-related objects; for example,
all of the pods, services, replication controllers, and
deployment configurations of a particular application can be grouped.

Labels are simple key/value pairs, as in the following example:

[source,yaml]
----
labels:
  key1: value1
  key2: value2
----

Consider:

* A pod consisting of an `nginx` container, with the label `role=webserver`.

* A pod consisting of an `Apache httpd` container, with the same label `role=webserver`.

A service or replication controller that is defined to use pods with the
`role=webserver` label treats both of these pods as part of the same group.

has more information on labels.
