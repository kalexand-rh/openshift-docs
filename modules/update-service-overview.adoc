== The {product-title} update service

The {product-title} update service is the hosted service that provides over the air updates to both
{product-title} and RHEL CoreOS. It provides a graph, or diagram that contain
_vertices_ and the _edges_ that connect them, of component Operators. The edges
in the graph show which versions you can safely upgrade to, and the vertices
vertices are update payloads that specify the intended state of the managed cluster components.
The Cluster Version Operator checks with the {product-title} update service and determines valid upgrades and upgrade paths
based on current component versions and information in the graph. If you
configure it to do so, the {product-title} update service sends the release artifacts that it needs to
perform the upgrade to your image registry, and the Cluster Version Operator
upgrades your cluster. By accepting automatic updates, you can automatically
keep your cluster up to date with the most recent compatible components.

To allow the {product-title} update service to provide only compatible updates, a release verification
pipeline exists to drive automation. Each release artifact is verified for
compatibility with supported cloud platforms and system architectures as well
as other component packages. After the pipeline confirms the suitability of a
release, the {product-title} update service can apply the update to your cluster or notify you that it
is available.

////
The interaction between the registry and the {product-title} update service is different during
bootstrap and continuous update modes. When you bootstrap the initial
infrastructure, the Cluster Version Operator finds
the fully qualified image name for the shortname of the images that it needs to
apply to the server during installation. It looks at the image stream that it needs
to apply and renders it to disk. It calls bootkube and waits for a temporary minimal control
plane to come up and load the Cluster Version Operator.
////

During continuous update mode, two controllers run. One continuously updates
the payload manifests, applies them to the cluster, and outputs the status of
the controlled rollout of the Operators, whether they are available, upgrading,
or failed. The second controller polls the {product-title} update service to
determine if updates are available.
