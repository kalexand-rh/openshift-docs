= Installation options

In {product-title} version 4.0, you can install only clusters that use
Installer Provisioned Infrastructure in Amazon Web Services (AWS).
These clusters use RHEL CoreOS
nodes as the operating system. Future versions of {product-title} will support
clusters that use both Installer Provisioned Infrastructure
and User Provisioned Infrastructure on more cloud providers and on bare metal.
With all cluster types, you must use RHEL CoreOS as the operating system for
control plane nodes.
////
If you want to
use any other cloud or install your cluster on-premise, use the bring your own
infrastructure option to install your cluster on existing Red Hat Enterprise
Linux (RHEL) hosts.
////

Using Installer Provisioned Infrastructure offers full-stack automation to:

* Manage compute
* Manage operating system (RHCOS)
* Manage control plane
* Manage nodes

////
With the bring your own infrastructure option, you have more responsibilities.
You must provide the hosts and update RHEL on them. {product-title} provides:

* Managed control plane
* Ansible to manage kubelet and container runtime
////

Installation and upgrade both use an Operator
that constantly reconciles component versions as if it were any other Kubernetes
controller.
