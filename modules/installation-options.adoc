= Installation options

{product-title} offers two installation options: fully-managed infrastructure and bring your own
infrastructure. In version 4.0, the fully-managed option allows you to install a
cluster in Amazon Web Services (AWS) that runs on Red Hat CoreOS nodes. If you want to
use any other cloud or install your cluster on-premise, use the bring your own
infrastructure option to install your cluster on existing Red Hat Enterprise 
Linux (RHEL) hosts.

The fully-managed option offers full-stack automation to:

* Manage compute
* Manage operating system (RHCOS)
* Manage control plane
* Manage nodes

The bring your own infrastructure option, you have more responsibilities.
You must provide the hosts and update RHEL on them. {product-title} provides:

* Managed control plane
* Ansible to manage kubelet and runtime


With both installation types, installation and upgrade both use a controller
that constantly reconciles component versions as if it were any other Kubernetes
controller.
