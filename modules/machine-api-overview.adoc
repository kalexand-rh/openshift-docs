= Machine API overview

On fully-managed {product-title} clusters, the Machine API performs all node
management actions after the cluster installation finishes. Because of this
system, {product-title} version 4.0 offers an elastic, dynamic provisioning
method.

The Machine API is a combination of primary resources that are based on the upstream
link:https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api[Cluster API] project and
custom {product-title} resources.

The three primary resources are:

`Machines`:: A fundamental unit that describes a node host. A `machine` has a
class, which describes the types of compute nodes that are offered for different
cloud platforms. For example, a `machine` type for a worker node on Amazon Web
Services (AWS) might define a specific machine type and required metadata.
`MachineClasses`:: A unit that defines a class of `machines` and facilitates
configuration reuse across `machines` of the same class. This unit functions
like a `StorageClass` for PersistentVolumeClaims.
`MachineSets`:: Groups of machines. `MachineSets` are to `machines` as
`ReplicaSets` are to `Pods`. If you need more `machines` or need to scale them down,
you change the *replicas* field on the `MachineSet` to meet your compute need.


The following custom resources add more capabilities to your cluster:

`MachineAutoscaler`:: This resource automatically scales `machines` in
a cloud. You can set the minimum and maximum scaling boundaries for nodes in a
specified `MachineSet`, and the `MachineAutoscaler` maintains that range of nodes.
`MachineHealthChecker`:: This resource detects when a machine is unhealthy,
deletes it, and, on supported platforms, makes a new machine.
`ClusterAutoscaler`:: This resource is based on the upstream
link:https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/cluster-autoscaler[Cluster Autoscaler]
project. In the {product-title} implementation, it is integrated with the
Cluster API by extending the `MachineSet` API.
`ClusterAutoscalerOperator`:: Instead of interacting with the `ClusterAutoscaler`
itself, you use its Operator. The `ClusterAutoscalerOperator` manages
the `ClusterAutoscaler` deployment. With this Operator, you can set cluster-wide
scaling limits for resources such as cores, nodes, memory, and GPU.
and so on. You can set the priority so that the cluster prioritizes pods so that
new nodes are not brought online for less important pods. You can also set the
ScalingPolicy so you can scale up nodes but not scale them down.


In 3.x, you couldn't roll out a multi-az architecture easily because the cluster
did not manage machine provisioning. It's easier in 4.0. Each machinset is scoped
to a single az so the installer will actually send out machinesets across AZs
on your behalf. And then because your compute is actually dynamic here, and in 
the face of a zone failure, you always have a zone for when you need to rebalance
your machines. the autoscaler proviedes best-effort balancing over the life of a cluster.
