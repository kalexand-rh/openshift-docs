= {product-title} clusters on clouds

[IMPORTANT]
====
In version {product-version}, you can install {product-title} on only Amazon
Web Services (AWS) or your own hosts.
====

You can install either a standard cluster or a customized cluster. With a
standard cluster, you specify the minimum number of details to establish the
cluster. These details include ...

With a customized cluster, you can specify more details of the installation, 
such as ...

When you install a fully-managed {product-title} cluster, you download the
installer from link:try.openshift.com. This site manages:
* Rest API for accounts
* Registry tokens, which are the pull secrets that you use to obtain the required
components
* Cluster registration, which associates the cluster identity to your Red Hat
account to facilitate usage metrics gathering

In {product-title} version 4.0, the installer is a go binary that performs a
series of file transformations on a set of assets. With the fully-managed option,
you delegate the infrastructure bootstrapping and provisioning to the installer
instead of doing it yourself. Because you do not use the installer to upgrade or
update your cluster, if you do not highly customize your cluster, you run the
installer only once.

You use three sets of files during installation: an installation configuration
file, Kubernetes manifests, and Ingition configurations for your machine types.

The installation configuration file is transformed into Kubernetes manifests, and
then the manifests are wrapped into Ignition configurations. The installer uses
these Ingition configurations to create the cluster.

The install configuration files are all pruned when you run the installer,
so be sure to back up all configuration files that you want to use again.

You cannot modify the parameters that you set during installation. You have to

There are individual commands to perform the different actions in cluster creation
if you want to try to make customizations, but you can run openshift-install
create cluster to get the default cluster done quick.
