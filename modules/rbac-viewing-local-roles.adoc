= Viewing local roles and bindings

You can use the `oc` CLI to view local roles and bindings by using the
`oc describe` command.

.Prerequisites

* Install the `oc` CLI.
* Obtain permission to view the local roles and bindings:

ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
** Users with the *dedicated-cluster-admin* role can view and manage local roles and bindings. 
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
** Users with the *cluster-admin* default cluster role bound cluster-wide can
perform any action on any resource, including viewing local roles and bindings.
endif::[]

** Users with the *admin* default cluster role bound locally can view and manage
roles and bindings in that project.
