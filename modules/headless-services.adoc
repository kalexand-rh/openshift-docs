= Headless services
If your application does not need load balancing or single-service IP addresses,
you can create a headless service. When you create a headless service, no
load-balancing or proxying is done and no cluster IP is allocated for this
service. For such services, DNS is automatically configured depending on whether
the service has selectors defined or not.

*Services with selectors*: For headless services that define selectors, the
endpoints controller creates `Endpoints` records in the API and modifies the
DNS configuration to return `A` records (addresses) that point directly to the
pods backing the service.

*Services without selectors*: For headless services that do not define
selectors, the endpoints controller does not create `Endpoints` records.
However, the DNS system looks for and configures the following records:

** For `ExternalName` type services, `CNAME` records.
** For all other service types, `A` records for any endpoints that share a name
with the service.

The benefit of using a headless service is that you can discover a pod's IP
address directly. Standard services act as load balancer or proxy and give
access to the workload object by using the service name. With headless services,
the service name resolves to the set of IP addresses of the pods that are
grouped by the service.
