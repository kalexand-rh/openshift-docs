= About Jobs

A Job is similar to a ReplicationController, in that its purpose is to create
pods for specified reasons. The difference is that ReplicationControllers are
designed for Pods that will be continuously running, whereas Jobs are for
one-time Pods. A Job tracks any successful completions and when the specified
amount of completions have been reached, the Job itself is completed.

The following example computes Ï€ to 2000 places, prints it out, then completes:
