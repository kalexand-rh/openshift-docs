= GitOps in {product-title}

You can use a GitOps methodology and tool set to create repeatable and predictable processes for managing and recreating {product-title} clusters and the applications that you deploy to them. By using GitOps, you can address infrastructure configurations and application configuration, or both, and simplify the propagation of infrastructure and application configurations changes across multiple clusters. Implementing GitOps for your cluster configuration files can make automated installation easier and allow you to configure automated cluster customizations.

With GitOps, you apply the core principles of developing and maintaining software in a Git repo to the creation and management of your cluster and application configuration files. The content in the Git repository is the single source for the configuration files that you use, and all of the changes that contributors make to those files are completed in changes that can be traced and audited. When you modify the configuration files in the Git repository, the changes are dynamically applied to your cluster and applications.

== GitOps for multi-cluster administration

When you need to manage multiple independent or cooperative {product-title} clusters, you can use use a GitOps strategy to:

* Ensure that these clusters have similar state for configuration, monitoring, storage, and so on
* Recover or recreate clusters from a known state
* Create clusters with a known state
* Apply configuration changes to multiple {product-title} clusters
* Revert configuration changes to multiple {product-title} clusters
* Associate templated configuration with different environments

== GitOps for application configuration management

You can also use GitOps practices to mange application configuration. This practice ensures consistency in applications when you need to deploy them to different clusters in different environments, such as development, stage, and production, during their life cycle. Managing application configuration with GitOps is also beneficial when you need to deploy applications across multiple clusters, whether on clouds or on-premises, for availability and scalability purposes.

You can use a GitOps strategy to:

* Promote applications across clusters, such as from stage to productiom
* Apply application changes to multiple {product-title} clusters
* Revert application changes to multiple {product-title} clusters
