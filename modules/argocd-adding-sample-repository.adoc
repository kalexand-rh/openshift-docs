= Adding the ArgoCD samples repository

Add your fork of the repository that contains sample {product-title} configuration files to use with ArgoCD to your ArgoCD instance.

.Prerequisites

* You forked the ArgoCD samples repository.
* You added an ArgoCD application to your {product-title} cluster.

.Procedure

Add our build configuration repository to ArgoCD. The build configuration repository has a `pre` and `pro` kustomize overlay which will override the build `imageLabels` by cluster but we will start by deploying the base build configuration.
