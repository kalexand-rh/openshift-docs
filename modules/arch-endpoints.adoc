= Endpoints

The servers that back a service are called its endpoints, and are
specified by an object of type `Endpoints` with the same name as the
service. When a service is backed by pods, those pods are normally
specified by a label selector in the service specification, and
{product-title} automatically creates the Endpoints object pointing to
those pods.

In some cases, you may want to create a service but have it be backed
by external hosts rather than by pods in the {product-title} cluster.
In this case, you can leave out the `selector` field in the service,
and create the Endpoints object manually.

Note that {product-title} will not let most users manually create an
Endpoints object that points to an IP address in the network blocks reserved for
pod and service IPs. Only cluster admins or other users with
permission to `create` resources under `endpoints/restricted` can create such
Endpoint objects.
